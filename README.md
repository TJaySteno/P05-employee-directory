## Project 5
### Use a Public API to Create an Employee Database

My task for this project is to create a page loading 'employee records' at random from a public API. I have been given nothing more than two images of how to style the page. Therefore, I will be creating the html and stylesheet from scratch for the first time during this program (but not for the first time of course). I will begin by creating a single template in html and styling it and the rest of the page how I need it. Once complete, I will delete it from index.html and load the specified number of profiles straight from my app. To achieve this, I will use a loop calling a constructor function. Finally, when a profile is selected, it will need to be highlighted in a manner I'm unsure how to achieve at this time so I'm looking forward to figuring that out.
