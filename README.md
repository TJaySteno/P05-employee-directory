## Project 5
### [Use a Public API to Create an Employee Directory](https://tjaysteno.github.io/P05-employee-directory/ "See it now")

My task for this project was to create a page that loads "employee records" from a public API. While past projects had provided me with HTML and CSS, this one simply provided me with 2 pictures of mockups that I was to emulate. Therefore, this was my first Tech Degree project where I built all my own HTML and CSS from scratch (though I had done it on my own projects before this). To complete this project, I made and styled a single employee div that I populate with results from the API and duplicate. These have been styled into a grid. Finally, a user can click on an employee div to view their modal window with more info on that person.

__Grade:__ Exceeds Expectations

__Grader's Overall Comments:__ "Excellent work! Your Public API project is great! Your API call functions nicely. Your code and directory are clean and well organized. And your project's UI is smooth and pleasing. Fantastic work all around!

"As you move on to your next project, keep up the great work! And keep shooting for those exceeds grades! The time spent attempting to hit those exceeds criteria will strengthen your skills, add to your experience and give you cooler projects to show off at the end of this Techdegree.

"This next project is all about Node.js. It is perhaps a step up in difficulty, and may seem like a real head-scratcher at first. You may feel like you're just starting to really get the hang of all this JavaScript and now it goes and gets even more complicated with this new Node stuff. But trust me. It's totally worth it. Node is so cool and so powerful once you get the hang of it. Just take your time and ask as many questions in Slack as you need. With the skills you've already demonstrated, I know that you can handle it.

"Good luck and happy coding as you move forward! You rock! :)"
